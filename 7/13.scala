It doesn't use the `ExecutorService` at all. It's always done and can't be cancelled. Its `get` method simply returns the value that we gave it.

Since this blocking occupies a thread in our thread pool, or whatever resource backs the `ExecutorService`, this implies that we're losing out on some potential parallelism. Essentially, we're using two threads when one should suffice. This is a symptom of a more serious problem with the implementation, and we will discuss this later in the chapter.
